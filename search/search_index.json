Traditional go-to solutions like metal halide (MH) and compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) are being phased out and replaced by LED alternatives. However, off-the-shelf LED grow light modules often come in standardized sizes that don't align well with all grow tent dimensions.</p> <p>For instance, many commercial light fixtures are optimized for 1x1 meter tents, which leaves few viable options for other setups. In the case of a 90x60 cm tent, suitable high-quality lighting options are practically nonexistent.</p>"},{"location":"background/#project-goals","title":"Project Goals","text":"<p>The primary objective of this project is to develop a modular lighting solution adaptable to various grow tent sizes, beginning with a system tailored for a 90x60 cm footprint. The technical aim is to design a lighting setup that not only fits this specific tent size but also surpasses the performance of a 300W CFL bulb in terms of light quality and efficiency.</p> <p>To better understand the baseline, here is a comparison of common CFL grow lights:</p> Wattage Lumens Lumens/W Color Temp Approx. PPF (\u00b5mol/s) Notes 125W 7,000 56 6400K ~100 Suitable for propagation and vegetative growth. Source 150W 10,000 67 5000K ~120\u2013130 Daylight white, ideal for general plant growth.

Source 300W 18,000 60 2700K ~240 Enhanced lumen output for extensive coverage. Source <p>Note: PPF values are approximations, as CFLs typically have low photon efficiency (~0.8\u20131.0 \u00b5mol/J).</p> <p>While lumens measure perceived brightness for humans, PPF reflects the number of photons in the 400\u2013700 nm range (photosynthetically active radiation, or PAR) that plants can actually use.
