Over the past few years, the global shift away from metal halide (MH) and compact fluorescent (CFL) lighting has opened the door to a wide range of modern horticulture lighting options. As part of this project, several alternatives have been evaluated for suitability in a modular LED-based grow light system.

Below are two main categories of LED components that were considered: **discrete mid-power LEDs** and **COB (chip-on-board) modules**. Each offers different trade-offs in terms of output, efficiency, heat management, and cost.
