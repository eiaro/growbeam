This section documents the design strategies and component choices that were evaluated during the early phases of the GrowBeam project, and why they were ultimately rejected or not chosen.

## Light Sources

### ❌ Preassembled LED Strips

**Pros:**
- Cheap and widely available
- Easy to apply and cut to length

**Cons:**
- Low efficiency (~1.0–1.5 µmol/J)
- Poor heat dissipation
- Not horticulture-specific spectrum
- Adhesives fail in humid environments

→ **Rejected** due to lack of durability and light quality.

---

### ❌ Larger MCPCBs (Starboards or Panels)

**Pros:**
- Pre-mounted horticulture LEDs
- Simplifies PCB design

**Cons:**
- Fixed layout; not modular
- Often pre-bundled with unsuitable drivers
- Higher cost per µmol

→ **Rejected** due to poor fit for custom tent dimensions.

---

### ❌ Parallel COB Panels

**Pros:**
- Very high light output
- Fewer components and drivers

**Cons:**
- Localized heat, needs large heatsinks
- Poor uniformity without optics
- Inflexible layout

→ **Rejected** due to heat and canopy coverage limitations.

### ✅ Discrete LEDs on Modular Bars

- Multiple low-power LEDs evenly spaced
- Passive cooling via aluminum extrusion
- Flexible layout for tents of various sizes
- Balanced white and red spectrum control

→ **Eventually chosen** for optimal balance of output, cost, and mechanical flexibility.

## Dimensions

It was clear from the beginning that some kind of structural support would be necessary, and aluminum offers both mechanical rigidity and excellent thermal conductivity.

The width of **20 mm** aligns with commonly available flatbars and U- or L-profiles. The **150 mm length** was chosen as a compromise between:
- Manufacturability using standard aluminum lengths
- Alignment with common grow tent dimensions (multiples of 30/60/90/120 cm)

**Thermal Fit:** Each module offers enough surface area to passively dissipate the heat generated by the LEDs.  
**Mechanical Simplicity:** Fits standard aluminum U-channels without custom machining.  
**Modular Flexibility:** Example layout: 4 modules x 150 mm = 600 mm length × 5 rows = 90 cm width — ideal for a 90×60 cm grow tent.

## Summary

GrowBeam’s design was guided by a few clear principles:
- Maximize photon efficiency with passive cooling
- Adapt easily to irregular tent sizes
- Rely on components available to hobbyists and small-scale builders

These goals shaped everything from the LED layout to the mechanical frame. The result is a grow light system that is simple, scalable, and surprisingly powerful — without the noise, bulk, or inefficiencies of legacy lighting.
