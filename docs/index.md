# üå± GrowBeam

GrowBeam is an open hardware project focused on building **modular, efficient, and DIY-friendly LED lighting** for indoor horticulture. Whether you're growing microgreens on a windowsill or managing a full-sized grow tent, GrowBeam aims to provide:

- üß© Modular design to fit any tent or tray size  
- üí° High-efficiency horticulture-grade LEDs  
- üîß Simple, fanless thermal design  
- üõ†Ô∏è Fully documented: schematics, BOM, 3D models, and rationale
