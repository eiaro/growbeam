Looking into the market for growtent and actually most grow systems, it seems to be a convention that they are based on 30 cm. Sizes is usually in steps like 30/60/90/120/240. 

As a goal for the project is to be universal, 150mm sizing sounds like a good compromiss on fitting the convension and production capabilities. 

The modules will need a structural (and thermal) backing, and when looking at what profiles is available from cheap sources 20 mm seems like a good compromiss. One can easily get flatbars and U/L-channels from almost any hardware store.

- **Thermal Fit:** Each module offers enough surface area to passively dissipate the heat generated by the LEDs.  
- **Mechanical Simplicity:** Fits standard aluminum U-channels without custom machining.  
- **Modular Flexibility:** Example layout: 4 modules x 150 mm = 600 mm length × 5 rows = 90 cm width — ideal for a 90×60 cm grow tent.
