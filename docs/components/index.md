Over the past few years, the global shift away from metal halide (MH) and compact fluorescent (CFL) lighting has opened the door to a wide range of modern horticulture lighting options. As part of this project, several alternatives have been evaluated for suitability in a modular LED-based grow light system.

Starting with common LED strips, it was hard to source strips with the power needed for the project to succeed. This was rather quickly eliminated as an option. Then there are many premade boards similar to our own project, but either they are hard to source or they have wrong type of LEDs - making a good light and a grow light isn't the same.

**COB (chip-on-board) modules** is very appealing. They give almost all the features we need and they are simple to implement. However the heat they emitt would cause hotspots that would complicate the thermal considerations. 

Below are two main categories of LED components that were considered: **discrete mid-power LEDs** and **COB (chip-on-board) modules**. Each offers different trade-offs in terms of output, efficiency, heat management, and cost. But with **discrete mid-power LEDs** we can evenly space out the heat emitting devices. 

The decision to move forward with LEDs seems like a very viable solution. The exact devices and quantity will be determined after the [Mechanical](mechanical.md) is set.
