# ðŸ”§ Production

## PCB

- PCB size: 196 mm Ã— 35 mm
- Mounting holes for screw attachment to the frame
- Silkscreen with LED type and polarity

## Assembly

- LEDs are mounted using reflow soldering
- Modules are screwed to the aluminum frame
- Wires are soldered and connected to +VDC and â€“VDC

## Operation & Safety

- The system is powered only via Meanwell ELG-240-42AB-3Y
- Ensure proper heat dissipation via the frame and/or heatsinks
- Do not operate without connected load

## Future Plans

- Temperature monitoring per module
- PWM dimming via analog input on the driver
- Sensor-based light control
